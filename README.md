## Dynamic CSV Table With search:
**dynamic_csv_table_with_search.html**  is Perplexity made html script to read a csv and transfer the content to a table with a chosen number of columns and search engine by field is included. 

## Gender Guesser
**gender.html** Is a gender guesser script, it is an xHTML script that permit to predict gender based on a few criteras : words frequency and weights associated to words on a given text. Actually this script permit to predict the gender Male, Female , or AI. I precise that this script is actually experimental and purely statistics and algorithmic. For basis it is a simple way to detect language from a corpus , written in Informal or formal style by the author. This script support multiples languages.
